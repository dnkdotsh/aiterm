## 1. Provided "AS IS" Without Warranty

This software is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. This is to make it clear that the software is a work in progress and may contain bugs or behave in unexpected ways. We make no promises regarding its reliability, accuracy, or fitness for any particular purpose.

## 2. Not For Production Use

This is a tool for personal experimentation and development. It is **NOT** intended for production or business-critical environments. Using this tool for such purposes is strongly discouraged. We are not liable for any business failures, data loss, or other damages resulting from its use in a commercial setting.

## 3. YOU Are Responsible For All API Costs

This client makes calls to paid API services (OpenAI, Google Gemini). You, and you alone, are responsible for every token sent and received, and for the resulting bill from the service provider.

An unexpected bug, incorrect usage, or a misconfiguration could result in a large number of API calls, leading to a significant, unexpected bill. We are **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for any charges you incur.

**You must actively monitor your API usage and set appropriate spending limits with your provider. Your budget is YOUR responsibility.**

## 4. AI-Generated Content

The large language models this client connects to can be confidently wrong, generate inaccurate information, or produce biased or otherwise undesirable content. Do not rely on AI-generated output for professional advice (e.g., medical, legal, or financial). Always verify critical information from a trusted source.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

In short, if something goes wrong—including but not limited to data loss, API overages, or other adverse outcomes—you assume all risk. By using this software, you accept full responsibility for any and all outcomes of its use.

## 6. O'Doyles Rule.

'nuff said.
